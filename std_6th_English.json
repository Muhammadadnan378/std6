Rhyming words are often used in the verse at the end of the lines. List the rhyming words from the poem. Note the words 'behind' and 'wind'. They have similar spellings, that is they look the same. But they are pronounced differently, that is, they do not 'sound' the same. This is known as 'eye rhyme'. Separate the examples of eye rhymes from the following list.",
